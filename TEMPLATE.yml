# Configuration template - Base your bindgen configuration on this!

# A note on templates: Some values are "templated".  This means they're of type
# `String`.  All occurences of the percent-sign ("%") will be replaced by a
# computed value.
# Additionally, templated strings allow access to environment variables  using
# curly braces: `{CC}` would be expanded to the value of `ENV["CC"]`.  It's
# possible to provide a fall back value, which is used only if the given
# environment variable doesn't exist: `{CC|gcc}` would expand to `ENV["CC"]`,
# or if it is not set, to `gcc`.  You can also put a percent-sign in there:
# `{LIBRARY_PATH|%}` will expand to `ENV["LIBRARY_PATH"]`, or to the replacement
# value otherwise.

# Defines the `module X` into which *all* code will be put.
#   Mandatory!
module: MyStuff

# Defines how conversions in C/C++ shall happen.  Use `boehmgc-cpp` for C++,
# or `boehmgc-c` for pure C.
#
# Don't worry too much about this setting at first.
cookbook: boehmgc-cpp # Default!

# Defines the `ld_flags` value for the `@[Link]` directive of the generated `lib`.
# `%` will be replaced by the path to the base-directory of your project,
# relative to the path of the generated `.cr` file.
library: "%/ext/binding.a"

# Processors pipeline.  See `README.md` for details on each.
# Defaults to the following:
processors:
  # Graph-refining processors:
  - default_constructor # Create default constructors where possible
  - function_class # Turn OOP-y C APIs into real classes
  - inheritance # Mirror inheritance hierarchy from C++
  - copy_structs # Copy structures as marked
  - macros # Support for macro mapping
  - functions # Add non-class functions
  - filter_methods # Throw out filtered methods
  - extern_c # Directly bind to pure C functions
  - instantiate_containers # Actually instantiate containers
  # Preliminary generation processors:
  - crystal_wrapper # Create Crystal wrappers
  - virtual_override # Allow overriding C++ virtual methods
  - cpp_wrapper # Create C++ <-> C wrappers
  - crystal_binding # Create `lib` bindings for the C wrapper
  - sanity_check # Shows issues, if any

# Generator configuration.  These write the actual output to disk.

# Map of classes to bind to.  A class inheriting another class should follow
# *after* that base-class.
classes:
  # Maps from the name of the C++ class, to the Crystal class.
  CppClassName: CrystalClassName
  MayBeEqual: MayBeEqual # This is fine, too.

# Map of enums to copy.
enums:
  # Maps from the name of the C++ enum, to the Crystal enum.
  # `CrystalEnumName` can reside in a wrapped class.
  CppEnumName: CrystalEnumName

# Map of macros (`#define`s) to copy.  Requires the `macros` processor.
macros:
  # Maps from a *regular expression*.  Rules are tried in the order they're
  # defined in the configuration file.  The expression must match the whole name
  # of the macro case-sensitively to be copied.
  "FOO_BAR_(.*)":
    # How to map matching macros:  Either put all into an enum, or as constant.
    map_as: Enum | Constant
    # Only if mapping as enum:  Treat as @[Flags] enum?
    # Defaults to `false`.
    flags: true | false
    # Only if mapping as enum:  C++ type to map as.  Defaults to "int".
    type: int
    # How the enum constants, or constants, name should end up.  Access to
    # capture groups in the regular expression is done using `\\n` to access the
    # n-th capture group.  The name will be post-processed automatically.
    #
    # If left out, the first capture group will be used.
    name: "\\1"
    # Where to store the matching constants.  For a enum, this is the path to
    # the enum itself (So, including the enums name).  For a constant, this is
    # the path to the class (or module) it will be stored in.
    destination: Foo::Bar

# Map functions outside of classes.  Useful to map C functions and C++
# namespaced functions as well.  Requires the `functions` (and `function_class`)
# processor.
functions:
  # Matches all functions whose fully-qualified name matches the key.
  # The qualified name of functions in the global scope is the function name
  # itself: The qualified name of `void foo();` is `foo`.  For C++ namespaced
  # methods, the qualified name includes the complete namespace path: The
  # qualified name of `namespace foo { void bar(); }` is thus `foo::bar`.
  #
  # Just like macros, the first capture group defaults to be the resulting
  # function name.  Without a capture group, the function name is copied.
  "net_(.*)": Util::Net # Equal to: `"net_(.*)": { destination: "Util::Net" }`
  # If you want more control:
  "string_(.*)":
    # Set a custom name for the function.  You can access capture groups from
    # the regular expression above.  You can omit this option.
    name: "string_\\1" # E.g., transform `strlen()` to `string_len()`
    # Names also support further nesting, if you don't use `class:`:
    #   name: "\1::\2"
    # Destination module or class the functions should be put into.  If using
    # `class:`, the name of the class itself.
    destination: Util::StringBuffer
    # You can also map all matched functions as class: With a little help,
    # bindgen can generate full wrapper classes!  If you don't want this,
    # leave the whole `class:` option out.
    # This feature requires the `function_class` processor.
    class:
      # Name of the backing structure.  The non-static functions take a pointer
      # to the structure as first argument.  Other functions are treated as
      # being static.

      # base class, put the name here.  Else, leave this out.

# List of container-types to wrap.  (Keyword: C++ Templates)
# Requires the `instantiate_containers` processor.  Optionally, you can also use
