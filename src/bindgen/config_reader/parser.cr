    # Pull parser for YAML configuration files, offering conditional branches
    # and access to external dependencies.
    #
    # **If you want to read a configuration** see `ConfigReader.from_yaml`.
    #
    # This is done by hooking into the pull parser, manually checking for the
    # conditional fields, and applying them accordingly.
    #
    # Apart from this logic, the configuration file is still valid YAML.
    #
    # **Note**: Conditionals and dependencies are *only* supported in
    # *mappings* (`Hash` in Crystal).  Any such syntax encountered in something
    # other than a *mapping* will not trigger any special behaviour.
    #
    # ## Condition syntax
    #
    # YAML documents can define conditional parts in *mappings* by having a
    # conditional key, with *mapping* value.  If the condition matches, the
    # *mapping* value will be transparently embedded.  If it does not match, the
    # value will be transparently skipped.
    #
    # Condition keys look like `if_X` or `elsif_X` or `else`.  `X` is the
    # condition, and it looks like `Y_is_Z` or `Y_match_Z`.  You can also use
    # (one or more) spaces (` `) instead of exactly one underscore (`_`) to
    # separate the words.
    #
    # * `Y_is_Z` is true if the variable Y equals Z case-sensitively.
    # * `Y_isnt_Z` is true if the variable Y doesn't equal Z case-sensitively.
    # * `Y_match_Z` is true if the variable Y is matched by the regular expression
    #   in `Z`.  The regular expression is created case-sensitively.
    # * `Y_newer_Z` is true when variable Y is newer or equals (>=) to Z,
    #   variables are treated as versions.
    # * `Y_older_Z` is true when variable Y is older or equals (<=) to Z,
    #   variables are treated as versions.
    #
    # A condition block is opened by the first `if`.  Later condition keys can
    # use `elsif` or `else` (or `if` to open a *new* condition block).
    #
    # **Note**: `elsif` or `else` without an `if` will raise an exception.
    #
    # Their behaviour is like in Crystal: `if` starts a condition block, `elsif`
    # starts an alternative condition block, and `else` is used if none of `if` or
    # `elsif` matched.  It's possible to mix condition key-values with normal
    # key-values.
    #
    # **Note**: Conditions can be used in every *mapping*, even in *mappings* of
    # a conditional.  Each *mapping* acts as its own scope.
    #
    # ### Variables
    #
    # Variables are set by the user of the class (Probably through
    # `ConfigReader.from_yaml`).  All variable values are strings.
    #
    # Variable names are **case-sensitive**.  A missing variable will be treated
    # as having an empty value (`""`).
    #
    # ### Examples
    #
    # ```yaml
    # foo: # A normal mapping
    #   bar: 1
    #
    # # A condition: Matches if `platform` equals "arm".
    # if_platform_is_arm: # In Crystal: `if platform == "arm"`
    #   company: ARM et al
    #
    # # You can mix in values between conditionals.  It won't "break" following
    # # elsif or else blocks.
    # not_a_condition: Hello
    #
    # # An elsif: Matches if 1) the previous conditions didn't match
    # # 2) its own condition matches.
    # elsif_platform_match_x86: # In Crystal: `elsif platform =~ /x86/`
    #   company: Many different
    #
    # # An else: Matches if all previous conditions didn't match.
    # else:
    #   company: No idea
    #
    # # At any time, you can start a new if sequence.
    # "if today is friday": # You can use spaces instead of underscores too
    #   hooray: true
    # ```
    #
    # ## Dependencies
    #
    # To modularize the configuration, you can require ("merge") external yaml
    # files from within your configuration.
    #
    # This is triggered by using a key named `<<`, and writing the file name as
    # value: `<<: my_dependency.yml`.  The file-extension can also be omitted:
    # `<<: my_dependency` in which case an `.yml` extension is assumed.
    #
    # The dependency path is relative to the currently processed YAML file.
    #
    # You can also require multiple dependencies into the same *mapping*:
    #
    # ```yaml
    # types:
    #   Something: true # You can mix dependencies with normal fields.
    #   <<: simple_types.yml
    #   <<: complex_types.yml
    #   <<: ignores.yml
    # ```
    #
    # The dependency will be embedded into the open *mapping*: It's transparent
    # to the client code.
    #
    # It's perfectly possible to mix conditionals with dependencies:
    #
    # ```yaml
    # if_os_is_windows:
    #   <<: windows-specific.yml
    # ```
    #
    # ### Errors
    #
    # An exception will be raised if any of the following occur:
    #
    # * The maximum dependency depth of `10` (`MAX_DEPTH`) is exceeded.
    # * The dependency name contains a dot: `../foo.yml` won't work.
    # * The dependency name is absolute: `/foo/bar.yml` won't work.
